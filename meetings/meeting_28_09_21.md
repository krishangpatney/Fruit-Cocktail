### Meeting Notes - 28/09/21
- What this project is meant to be
    - Identify the trade-offs for deploying microservice architecture in different ways in the cloud.
    - Such as deploying a microservice application on the cloud, and there are many options on how they can be set-up
    - The project tries to answer the best way of deploying microservices. What does that depend on.
    - Wanting to deploy a microservice application,
- Resources to use
    - Wait for confirmation on what cloud resource to use.
    - In the meanwhile I can use a local set-up and deploy docker images to it.
    - Need to experiment with different frameworks - [Link](https://github.com/delimitrou/DeathStarBench)
    - finding the best way of deploying docker containers with microservice applications automatically
    - finding the best way to collect data from these set-ups
        - Measuring it and then plotting it. Could require upto 1000 takes to get correct metrics. (Hence automation of process)
        - Measure - Preformance (Completion time), Response-time (requests per second)
- Planning ahead
    - Create a plan, allows to think ahead.
    - Can deviate from it later on, it's not a strict plan.
- Papers to read up
