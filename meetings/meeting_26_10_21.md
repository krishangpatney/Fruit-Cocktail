Use terraform 

1. Create scripts to setup VM's for me - Done
    1. use a resource group  
    2. Add apache & other dependancies
    3. clone git repo (Microservices) 
    4. start and configure the app on docker
2. See how terraform flows can be duplicated - This can create any number of VM's 
3. ERROR - Cannot use an old resource group yet. (there is a way to do so which I am yet to explore)
4. Will probably need 2/3 terraform configuration files for each application 
5. See how I can split a microservice based application to run on multiple servers 
6. See how terraform can automate deployment for multiple services on different VMs 
7. Look into API metrics, and how to measure & record these.
