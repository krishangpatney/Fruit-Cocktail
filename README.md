**Project** - Optimised Microservice Deployment in the Cloud

**Supervisor** - Yehia Elkhatib

**Description** - Using microservices is currently the prevalent architecture, where an application's logic is fragmented across numerous loosely coupled elements. The microservices approach presents new challenges of its own. This project investigates the different ways in which a cloud application with a microservice architecture could be deployed in an optimal way in the data center. You will be expected to have strong experience with Docker and CI/CD practices.
